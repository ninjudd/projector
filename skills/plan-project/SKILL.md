description: Create or refine a Git-native project plan under docs/projects. Use when the user wants to scope, design, prioritize, or record a project before or alongside implementation.

# Plan Project

Turn the requested outcome into a durable Projector plan that another person or
agent can execute without reconstructing the conversation.

## Establish context

1. Read the repository instructions and `docs/projects/README.md`.
2. Run `project list --json` and search for overlapping or parent projects.
3. Inspect the code and current documentation that constrain the work. Do not
   design from the request alone when the repository can answer a question.
4. Resolve the intended canonical name and whether this is a top-level or
   nested project. Ask only when different answers would materially change the
   project.

## Write the plan

Use `project create <name> --status <status> --no-edit`, or inspect the
existing project with `project show <name> --json`, edit its plan content,
and change scheduling with `project status <name> <status>`. Choose status
from the user's intent:

- Use `later` for recorded work that is not ready or prioritized.
- Use `next` for a plan ready to become current when capacity opens.
- Leave the transition to `now` to `work-project`, which keeps the readiness
  claim with the implementation pull request.
- Do not create a new plan as `done`.

Keep the plan proportional to the work. State the outcome, constraints,
acceptance evidence, implementation sequence, decisions with rejected
alternatives, and genuinely open questions. Add supporting files only when
they hold real content that would make the entry point unwieldy.

Number sections and append new sections without renumbering existing ones.
Write paths and identifiers exactly. Keep durable decisions in the plan rather
than relying on chat history.

## Validate and hand over

Run:

```sh
project show <name>
project check
git diff --check
```

Confirm that the status makes an honest readiness claim, the acceptance
criteria are observable, and every open question has an owner or deliberate
deferral. Leave the plan changes visible for ordinary Git review; do not commit,
push, or open a pull request unless the user or repository workflow asks for
those actions.
