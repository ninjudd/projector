# watch-prs.sh — emit one line per reviewable event across one or more GitHub
# repositories, and stay silent otherwise. Intended to run under Claude Code's
# `Monitor` with `persistent: true`, where each stdout line becomes one
# notification.
#
#   NEW PR     a pull request opened that the state file has not seen
#   NEW HEAD   a tracked pull request's head SHA moved
#   RESPONDED  every thread resolved and the head unchanged on a pull request
#              still waiting for one: a draft (self-review, where the verdict
#              never moves) or one at CHANGES_REQUESTED (cross-author, where
#              gating never applies). The author answered without pushing, so
#              no head event is coming. Once per head, and never alongside
#              NEW PR or NEW HEAD, which already say to review that head.
#   CLOSED     a tracked pull request left the open set
#   BRANCH     the watched worktree changed branch
#
# Usage:
#   watch-prs.sh --repos owner/a[,owner/b...] --state <path>
#                [--author login[,login...]] [--interval 60] [--worktree <dir>]
#
# --author narrows the watch to pull requests those logins authored, which is
# how the review loop keeps to the operator's own on a shared repository. Pass
# logins literally, never `@me`: `@me` is resolved against whichever token is
# live when the query runs, and under the review loop's GH_TOKEN that is the
# reviewing account, which authors nothing — the watch would then be silent
# from the first pass on, indistinguishable from a repository with nothing
# open. Without the flag every open pull request is watched. Filtering at the
# source matters most here, because this watcher's events are pushes: on a
# shared repository every push by anyone is one, none of them is the loop's to
# review, and every line here is a Monitor notification counting toward the
# limit that stops a watcher. watch-threads.sh takes the same flag, for the
# same reason, on the one event of its own that fires without review activity.
#
# The state file is the loop's memory of what has been seen. Seed it with rows
# of `<owner/repo> <number> <sha> <ref>` to baseline heads as already reviewed;
# an empty file means every watched pull request reports as new, which is the
# right default when the loop is establishing itself. The state file belongs
# to one scope: narrowing --author against an existing one reports the pull
# requests that left the watch as CLOSED once, so start a fresh file when the
# scope changes.
#
# Tracks up to 200 open pull requests per repository — per author, when
# --author is given, since each login is listed separately. That is a
# documented property rather than an accident: past the limit a tracked pull
# request would be missing from the answer and read as closed.
