# watch-threads.sh — emit one line per piece of outstanding review work across
# every open pull request in one or more GitHub repositories. Silent when
# nothing is outstanding. Intended to run under Claude Code's `Monitor` with
# `persistent: true`, where each stdout line becomes one notification.
#
#   FINDING   an unresolved review thread that has not been announced recently
#   VERDICT   a pull request sitting at CHANGES_REQUESTED, thread or no thread
#
# This watch is deliberately **level-triggered**: it reports what is currently
# unresolved rather than what just changed. An edge-triggered watch loses a
# finding permanently the one time it misses an edge — a thread posted while
# the watcher was starting, or during a network blip, is never "new" again and
# would go unmentioned forever. Re-announcing is the cheaper failure.
#
# Usage:
#   watch-threads.sh --repos owner/a[,owner/b...] --state <path>
#                    [--interval 60] [--renotify 900]
#
# --renotify is how many seconds before a still-unresolved thread is announced
# again. Set it high enough to be a reminder rather than a stream.

    # A verdict is outstanding work even with no thread attached to it. A
    # reviewer may put every finding in the review summary body and open no
    # inline thread at all, and then the thread query below is correctly
    # silent while the pull request sits blocked at CHANGES_REQUESTED. Watching
    # threads alone reads that as "nothing outstanding", which is the one
    # reading that must never be wrong. Asked per repository rather than per
    # pull request, because one query answers for all of them.
    # Paginated, and it has to be: GraphQL connections cap `first` at 100 —
    # `first:200` is rejected outright as EXCESSIVE_PAGINATION — so a single
    # page would watch verdicts for 100 pull requests while the thread query
    # above covers 200. That asymmetry fails in the worst available direction.
    # A pull request past the page still has its threads watched, so a review
    # with inline findings is still seen; the one lost is a review whose
    # findings live only in the summary body, which is precisely the case this
    # query exists to catch. `orderBy` is pinned so the traversal is stable
    # across pages rather than arbitrary.
    #
    # Ask `reviews(states:[CHANGES_REQUESTED])` rather than `latestReviews`.
    # `latestReviews` is the most recent review *per author* whatever its
    # state, and replying inside a thread files a COMMENTED review — so a
    # reviewer answering their own thread displaces their standing changes
    # request out of that connection while `reviewDecision` stays
    # CHANGES_REQUESTED. The pull request would pass the outer filter, match
    # nothing inside, and emit nothing: a false negative in exactly the case
    # this query exists to catch, and one that correlates with discussion, so
    # it goes quiet on the pull requests being argued about and stays loud on
    # the ones nobody has touched. `last:1` is one line per pull request
    # rather than per author, which is what the skill documents.
