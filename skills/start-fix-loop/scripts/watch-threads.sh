# watch-threads.sh — emit one line per unresolved review thread across every
# open pull request in one or more GitHub repositories. Silent when nothing is
# outstanding. Intended to run under Claude Code's `Monitor` with
# `persistent: true`, where each stdout line becomes one notification.
#
#   FINDING   an unresolved review thread that has not been announced recently
#
# This watch is deliberately **level-triggered**: it reports what is currently
# unresolved rather than what just changed. An edge-triggered watch loses a
# finding permanently the one time it misses an edge — a thread posted while
# the watcher was starting, or during a network blip, is never "new" again and
# would go unmentioned forever. Re-announcing is the cheaper failure.
#
# Usage:
#   watch-threads.sh --repos owner/a[,owner/b...] --state <path>
#                    [--interval 60] [--renotify 900]
#
# --renotify is how many seconds before a still-unresolved thread is announced
# again. Set it high enough to be a reminder rather than a stream.
