description: Implement a Projector project while keeping its plan and status current. Use when the user asks to start, continue, or complete work recorded under docs/projects.

# Work Project

Use the project plan as the durable statement of intent while treating the
repository and current runtime behavior as authoritative evidence.

## Start from the project

1. Read the repository instructions and run `project show <name> --json`.
2. Read the entry point, its supplemental files, relevant nested projects, and
   the code and documentation they cite.
3. Check every open question before claiming readiness. Resolve a product
   choice with the user when the repository cannot answer it.
4. Run `project status <name> in-progress` only when implementation truly
   begins, and `project priority <name> now` when the work also becomes the
   current focus. Keep both changes in the implementation pull request; do not
   open a status-only change.

## Implement coherent work

Build the requested outcome, not merely the easiest plan item. Keep changes
reviewable and verify each behavior in proportion to its risk. Follow the
repository's branch, stack, commit, review, and merge rules.

Update the project plan in the same change whenever implementation settles a
decision, changes scope, reveals a new constraint, or completes an acceptance
criterion. Append numbered sections rather than renumbering cited sections.
Create a nested project only when it has an independently useful lifecycle;
use a supplemental document for details belonging to the parent.

Do not infer a parent's status or priority from a child or vice versa. Do not
move project directories, generate a tracked status index, or duplicate either
field elsewhere.

## Verify the current slice

Run the repository's full validation gate plus:

```sh
project show <name>
project check
git diff --check
```

Compare the result against the plan's acceptance criteria. If required work
remains, record the exact state, leave the status `in-progress`, and set the
priority to `now`, `next`, or `later` as the user's real scheduling intent
requires. If every criterion is proven, continue with `finish-project` in the
same implementation change.
