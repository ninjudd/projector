# Personal notes (apply in every repository)

## The `docs/` and `docs/projects/` convention

Several repos (Modal, Fyra, Field, msg) share the same documentation layout, so
its conventions live here rather than drifting apart in each one. Each repo's
own `AGENTS.md` lists the docs it actually has.

- `docs/` describes how the system works today. Keep it current when behaviour
  changes.
- `docs/projects/` is the work itself: three lists — `now.md`, `next.md`,
  `later.md` — pointing into `all/`, where every plan lives and nothing ever
  moves. Read `docs/projects/README.md` before adding to it.
- Plans are cited by section (`onboarding.md §7`), including from code comments,
  so renumbering a section silently breaks references. Add new sections at the
  end.
- A plan whose status line is stale is worse than one with no status at all.

## Pull requests

**Open pull requests; never merge them.** Merging is my review checkpoint, no
matter how small or docs-only the change is. End the work at `gh pr create` and
hand over the URL. After I merge, sync local main before continuing.

Open them ready for review by default, even when they contain an approved
work-in-progress slice. Use draft status only when the pull request is genuinely
not ready for review and we intentionally do not want it reviewed yet. Do not
use draft status merely because more work is planned.

**Lean toward medium-to-large pull requests, not small-to-medium.** Reviewing
one costs real effort, and that effort is charged per pull request *and per
review cycle* while barely moving with diff size: resolving the exact head,
building, running the suite, probing the claims and writing the review cost
about the same for twenty lines as for three hundred. Two small pull requests
therefore cost roughly twice what one medium one carrying both does — and a
second review cycle on a single pull request is cheaper than a second pull
request, which is the counterintuitive half, because the instinct is to split
precisely to avoid another round.

So combine by default, and let splitting be the thing that needs an argument.
Phase chunks and plan sections are for sequencing thought, not for sizing pull
requests: two changes citing different plans belong together when they share a
rationale, when one is unusable until the other lands, or when verifying the
second means re-running the first. What replaces line count as the ceiling is
reviewability — too big is when a reviewer would be holding two unrelated
arguments at once, or when half of it could ship and be used while the rest is
still being written. Short of that, fold the follow-on into the pull request
that unblocked it: the one-file move, the doc sweep, the retirement its
predecessor made possible. A five-file, twenty-insertion pull request split off
only because it belonged to a different plan's chunk is the shape to stop
producing — its one claim could not be verified without the pull request
underneath it, so the review had to hold both anyway.

My repos are configured alike, and the ruleset is what enforces all of the
above: main takes no direct pushes, history stays linear, every review thread
must be resolved before a merge, and merges are squashed with the PR title and
body taken as the commit message verbatim. So write the title and body as the
commit message they are about to become — title in the imperative, body
explaining why rather than what.

That collides with the wrapping rule at the end of this file, and the wrapping
rule wins. PR bodies go up unwrapped, so the squashed commit message inherits
long unwrapped paragraphs: worse in `git log`, better everywhere the text is
actually read. Never hard-wrap a PR body to tidy the commit it becomes.

### Every PR body ends with how to try it

Close each description with a short **Testing** section: the exact commands to
run, in order, and what a person should see. Copy-pasteable — real label names,
real paths, no placeholders to fill in — and run them yourself first, from the
directory you tell me to run them from. A command in a PR body that errors is
worse than no instructions, because I find out by hitting the error.

Say plainly what needs building or installing first (`pnpm build` so the `field`
on my PATH is current, `field setup <worker>`, a native rebuild), and what state
it leaves behind — a spawned daemon, generated files, a modified checkout.

Name the thing that would show the change is *wrong*, not only the happy path.
"You should see X" is a demo; "before this you'd get Y here" is a test. Where a
change cannot be exercised by hand — a protocol version bump, a stale-daemon
guard — say that instead of inventing a ritual, and point at the test that does
cover it.

If a command in the section is not the one I would naturally reach for, that is
worth noticing rather than documenting around: I typed `field --version` for the
version report and got the bare number, which was the design working as written
and the wrong design.

## Stacked pull requests

Setting the second pull request's base to the first branch is the smallest part
of stacking, and on its own it produces two pull requests that merely share a
pointer. **Make it an actual stack**, which GitHub now supports natively —
stacked pull requests entered public preview on 2026-07-30, so this is a real
primitive rather than a convention to imitate.

**Create it as a stack.** The CLI is an official extension and is not installed
by default: `gh extension install github/gh-stack`, then `gh stack init <name>`,
`gh stack add <branch>`, `gh stack submit`. From the web UI, create the child
with its base set to the parent's branch and choose **Create stack** to link
them. Either way the result is what a base pointer alone does not give you: a
stack icon and a stack map in each pull request's merge box, listing every
layer with its status and letting a reviewer move between them.

That map is the reason to bother. A reviewer opening a child sees a correct diff
either way, but only a real stack tells them where they are in the series and
how much of it is theirs to review.

**The body is still the commit message.** A squashed merge takes it verbatim, so
keep stack scaffolding out of it — the stack map already says what is stacked on
what, which is precisely why it should not also be prose in the body that ships
into `git log`. Write the body as the commit message it becomes, as if the
branch had never been stacked. Anything a reviewer needs about the stack itself
goes in a comment, which merging discards.

**When the base moves, re-run the child's full gate.** A clean base does not
vouch for the child — the child's tests run against code the base just changed,
and no command re-runs the gate for you.

Restack with `gh stack sync`, not by hand. It cascade-rebases every branch onto
its updated parent and pushes them atomically with `--force-with-lease`, where
rebasing and force-pushing "the child" is one-layer thinking: on A ← B ← C,
restacking B alone leaves C parented on B's superseded tip, so C's pull request
shows B's old commits inside its own diff and its reviewer reads changes that
are not theirs. Nothing errors — you find out when someone reviews the wrong
diff. Use `gh stack rebase` for the rebase without the push. Fix a finding on
the branch that owns the code, the parent's if the code is the parent's, and
reply on whichever pull request carries the thread.

**Merging is still mine, and stacks make that easier to get wrong.** A stack can
be merged in one click, all layers together — so it is exactly the button not to
press. Open the stack and hand over the URLs. When I merge a base on its own,
check that the child retargeted and is still mergeable rather than assuming
both.

Public preview means subject to change, and merge-queue support was still
rolling out when this was written. Check the behaviour you depend on rather than
trusting this paragraph to have aged well.

## Pull request reviews are local by default

When I ask to "review this PR" (or equivalent), review the checked-out pull
request yourself: resolve its exact head, inspect the local diff and the code it
depends on, and verify every finding. A generic review request does **not**
select or authorize a separate Codex or Claude reviewer.

**Local means where the reviewing happens, not where the findings land.** Post
them to GitHub on the lines they concern — a review summarized only in the
terminal is not a review anyone else can act on, and it leaves nothing to reply
to or resolve later.

**Reviews go up as `minjudd`, not as me.** GitHub will not let an author approve
their own pull request, so a review posted from my account can only ever be a
comment — the weaker thing, and silently so. Findings are submitted as one
review carrying a verdict: `REQUEST_CHANGES` when there are any, `APPROVE` when
the head is clean. `start-review-loop` owns those mechanics and the identity
preflight that goes with them. `start-fix-loop` owns the other half — verifying
a finding, fixing it, replying, and resolving the thread, in that skill's order.
Neither is repeated here, so there is one place to change when it changes.

Codex and Claude CLI reviews are opt-in. Run one only when I explicitly name it
("run a Codex review", "run a Claude review") — that explicit request is what
authorizes sending the repository context needed for the review to the named
service. Use the selected CLI directly; do not start a review with an
`@codex review` comment.

To run one: resolve the pull request head, run the selected CLI against that
exact code, and wait for the CLI process to finish before acting on its results.
CI going green is unrelated to review completion. Keep me updated about once a
minute during longer review runs.

## Don't hard-wrap text written *to* GitHub

PR descriptions, issue bodies, and review comments render with GitHub's
hard-line-break extension: every single newline inside a paragraph becomes a
literal `<br>`. Wrapping that text at 72–80 columns produces visibly ragged
output — one short line after another, exactly as typed.

So write those as unwrapped paragraphs, one line per paragraph, however long.
Use real newlines only where they are structural: headings, list items, table
rows, code fences.

Markdown *files* in a repo are the opposite case. They follow CommonMark, where
a single newline inside a paragraph is just a space — so hard-wrapping is
invisible when rendered, and it keeps a one-word edit to a one-line diff. Match
whatever wrapping a repo's docs already use; don't reflow them.

Commit messages are a third thing again: not rendered as Markdown at all, so
this rule says nothing about them — with one exception that matters here. A
squashed merge takes the PR body verbatim, so on these repos the PR body *is*
the commit message, and it ships unwrapped. Wrap a commit message you write
yourself; never wrap a PR body to control what the merge produces.

Check a body that's already posted, rather than assuming:

```
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n> \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.html+json" --jq .body_html | grep -c '<br>'
```

Any `<br>` in a prose paragraph means the body went up hard-wrapped. Fix it by
rewriting the body with `gh pr edit <n> --body-file <file>`.
