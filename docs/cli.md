# Use the Projector CLI

Projector installs one command, `project`. It discovers the Git root from your
current directory and reads projects under `docs/projects/`. Pass
`--root <path>` to select a repository explicitly, or `--projects-dir <path>` to
use another project-plan directory.

Running the package as a module is equivalent when the command is not on your
`PATH`:

```sh
python3 -m projector check
```

## Adopt a repository

Run `init` once to create `docs/projects/README.md`:

```sh
project init
```

If projects already exist but the convention file is missing, `init` adds only
that file. It refuses to replace an existing convention file.

Every command except `init` and `check` requires that directory. When it is
missing, Projector names the path it looked for and exits 66 instead of
reporting an empty repository:

```console
$ project list
project: projects directory not found: docs/projects (run 'project init' to adopt the convention)
```

`check` is the exception, because reporting problems is its job: it records the
absent directory as a `missing-projects-dir` issue and exits 65 like any other
validation failure.

An adopted repository with no projects yet is not an error. `list` prints
nothing and exits 0.

## Browse projects

Run `list` to group projects by priority without creating an index. Each row
shows the project's status, and completed projects group together at the end:

```console
$ project list
now:
  projector                    in-progress  Turn agent-config into Projector
```

Add `--status ready` or `--priority next` to select one value, or both to
intersect them. Run `show <project>` to print the entry point, including its
frontmatter, or `search <query>` to search project names, metadata, plans, and
supplemental Markdown files.

`list` and `search` read every project, so one plan that does not match the
format fails the command rather than dropping that project from the results:

```console
$ project list
project: docs/projects/payments/readme.md: status must be one of now|next|later|done (run 'project check' for the full report)
```

Run `check` for every problem at once. `show <project>` still reads a single
valid plan while another plan is malformed.

Project names are paths relative to `docs/projects/`. For example,
`docs/projects/payments/invoices/readme.md` is `payments/invoices`.

## Create and update projects

Create a top-level or nested project:

```sh
project create payments --status ready --priority next
project create invoices --parent payments --priority later
```

`create` defaults to `--status draft` and `--priority later`.

`create` opens the new plan when stdin and stdout are interactive. Pass
`--no-edit` to leave the generated plan ready for another command. In a
non-interactive session, Projector never opens an editor.

Run `edit <project>` to open an existing plan with `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`.
`edit` has no `--json` mode because the editor owns the interactive session.
It exits 69 without a terminal or configured editor.

Change only the status scalar with `status`, only the priority scalar with
`priority`, or use `done` as a readable shorthand for
`status <project> completed`:

```sh
project status payments in-progress
project priority payments now
project done payments/invoices
```

`priority` adds the field when a plan has none, which happens only for a
completed project being rescheduled.

Projector preserves unrelated frontmatter, formatting, and uncommitted plan
content. It writes through a temporary file in the project directory and
refuses the update if the file changes after Projector reads it. Mutation
commands make no Git commits.

## Validate projects

Run `check` before handing over project changes:

```console
$ project check
Project plans are valid.
```

The command reports malformed frontmatter, invalid statuses, invalid or
missing priorities, missing top-level
plans, uppercase project entry points, case collisions, symlinks, malformed
Markdown links, and missing local link targets. It reads both directory entries
and Git's tracked paths so casing errors remain visible on case-insensitive
filesystems.

## Consume JSON

Pass `--json` to `init`, `list`, `show`, `search`, `create`, `status`,
`priority`, `done`, or `check`. Responses use stdout only for JSON and include
`"schema_version": 2`.

For example:

```console
$ project list --priority now --json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "projector",
      "owner": null,
      "path": "docs/projects/projector/readme.md",
      "priority": "now",
      "status": "in-progress",
      "title": "Turn agent-config into Projector"
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 2
}
```

Projector uses these exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | The command completed successfully. |
| `2` | Command syntax or an argument is invalid. |
| `65` | Project data is invalid or a mutation is unsafe. |
| `66` | The requested project or the projects directory does not exist. |
| `67` | The requested project is ambiguous. |
| `69` | Git or the interactive editor environment is unavailable. |
